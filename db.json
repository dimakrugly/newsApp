      "content": "Folks, just about every chain has secret menu items these days. Five Guys — the Washington, D.C.–born burger chain — is no exception. From grilled cheese customizations and hot dog variations, here are the Five Guys menu hacks that you need to know about.\n\n\n\nJust remember: Be nice to your Five Guys employees when attempting the Five Guys secret menu. Give them a break when they’re understaffed or in the middle of a lunch rush. You already know the vibes.\n\nburger bowl from Five Guys\nKristi M. / Yelp\nBurger Bowl\nTo call an aluminum Five Guys takeout container a bowl is a stretch, but if you’re cutting carbs, you can get your burger patty and all the fixings without the bun.\n\n\nThe Artery Annihilator\nOrder a bacon cheeseburger.\n\nAsk for a halved hot dog on top.\n\nWell-Done Fries\nThis is pretty self explanatory. Order some of those peanut oil-laden French fries and ask for them well-done.\n\n\n\nFor more secret menu guides, please sign up for our free newsletters.\n\n\n\nPatty Melt\nFive Guys has Texas toast-esque bread on standby, so order your burger on that, rather than the traditional bun. Voilà, instant patty melt.\n\n\nSloppy Joe\nWhile you cannot get an actual Sloppy Joe at Five Guys, there’s a decent way to simulate it. Allegedly, this tastes just like the real thing. A little bit of hot sauce works here, too.\n\nOrder a burger with no cheese.\n\nAdd grilled peppers and onions, ketchup, and barbecue sauce.\n\nThe Double-Double Dupe\nWhile you can attempt to recreate In-N-Out’s burger at Five Guys, I’d say you needn’t bother. Nobody can do what In-N-Out does. Nobody.\n\nOrder a cheeseburger and add an extra slice of American cheese.\n\nAdd lettuce, tomato, pickles, and grilled onions.\n\nMix ketchup, mayo, and relish together to create the special sauce.\n\nThrow some melted cheese onto some fries along with that sauce to recreate Animal Fries.\n\nRelated: 8 Burger King Menu Hacks To Try Right Now \n\nfive guys burger\nTim M. / Yelp\nPresidential Burger\nWhen President Obama stopped at Five Guys, this is what he got. \n\nOrder a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, jalapeño peppers, and mustard.\n\nChicago Dog\nThough Five Guys doesn’t have the crucial ingredients of sport peppers and celery salt, you can still hack your way to a Chicago-style hot dog. And with free toppings and Five Guys' menu prices, it's a steal under $5.\n\nOrder a hot dog with tomato, relish, green peppers, pickles, mustard, and Cajun seasoning.\n\nDouble Grilled Cheeseburger\nStart with any amount of beef patties you desire, and build your burger the way you like.\n\nThen, instead of buns, ask for two grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nGo for a run.\n\nMore from Cheapism:\n\nCostco Prepared Meals That'll Feed Your Whole Family\n\nFabulous Fast-Food Freebies and Deals at Taco Bell, McDonald's, and More Popular Chains This Month\n\nThese Are the 7 Cheapest Fast-Food Joints To Try Right Now\n\nAre Rao's Frozen Pizzas Any Good?

      "content": "36 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Disney\nDisney parks are known to house many secrets to keep the park alive and magical. Here are 36 of my favorite things about the park.\n\naureliefrance / istockphoto\naureliefrance / istockphoto\n1. Cats Clean The Grounds\nWhen Disney first opened, feral cats would sneak onto the grounds and catch the mice that inhabited the parks. Instead of fighting the problem, Disney embraced it. During the day, up to 200 cats lounge around on their own special feeding stations. At night, the cats are let out to keep the grounds free of mice.\n\nAnd the cats are well cared for, too. Males and females are spayed and neutered, and any kittens that join the family are put up for adoption.\n\nMatt Walker / Flickr\nMatt Walker / Flickr\n2. The Manhole Covers In ToonTown Play Music\nJump on one and see what music it plays! Hint: the sounds correspond with the instruments on the fountain these covers surround.\n\nDepositPhotos.com\nDepositPhotos.com\n3. You Won’t See A Character Point Their Finger\nAt least not with a single finger, as it’s considered rude in some cultures. Most often, they gesture with two fingers or a sweeping hand.\n\nphilinnz4 / istockphoto\nphilinnz4 / istockphoto\n4. There Are Thousands Of Mickey Mouse Heads Hidden In The Park\nNext time you’re there, see how many you can find!\n\nManakin / istockphoto\nManakin / istockphoto\n5. There Is An Entire Network Of Underground Tunnels Beneath The Park\nThis not only helps keep characters from being in the wrong “land” (i.e. a Cowboy in Tomorrowland) but prevents guests from seeing two of the same characters (i.e. two Cinderellas) at once during a shift change.\n\nGeorge / Flickr\nGeorge / Flickr\n6. The Hitching Posts On Main Street Are Painted Every Night\nAnother small piece of evidence the attention to detail in the parks. Each night, the highly touched hitching posts are stripped and repainted so they look fresh the next morning for the next round of guests.\n\nIn fact, the starting time these posts are painted is based on the humidity and temperature to ensure they’re dry in the morning and no one gets sticky fingers.\n\nugajewel / Flickr\nugajewel / Flickr\n7. The Teacups Spin At Different Speeds\nDesigned to give a fun experience for all, pick an orange teacup with diamonds if you want to spin fast and pink one with hearts if you want to go slower.\n\nawl11 / Flickr\nawl11 / Flickr\n8. The Animal Kingdom Has Scientists\nThey study the animals and their behaviors. One one trip to Africa, they discovered a special call elephants make in relation to alerting each other about bees.\n\nEnchantedFairy / iStock\nEnchantedFairy / iStock\n9. The Castles Aren’t As Big As They Look\nThe stones near the bottom of the castles are larger than the stones at the top. This optical illusion gives observers the appearance that the castle is actually taller. This effect is also used on the Haunted Mansion and buildings on Main Street.\n\nBR WDW / Flickr\nBR WDW / Flickr\n10. The Haunted Mansion Has A Pet Cemetery\nIf you’re lucky and ask the right person, you may just get a private tour.\n\njohn koenig * / Flickr\njohn koenig * / Flickr\n11. Over 800 Species Of Plants Are Used To Create Authenticity\nFor example, at the Polynesian Hotel, Polynesian plants are used to create a true and authentic feel of being on the Polynesian Islands. At the Wilderness Lodge, moose tracks and large, native vegetation are used to create a cooler environment, like you’re out west.\n\nsmckenzie / istockphoto\nsmckenzie / istockphoto\n12. All The Costumes Are Hand Made\nHand stitching and fabrics relevant to a specific period in time is used to create authenticity. To add, gold thread is used on relevant costumes to create a special sparkle. This not only gives each character extra pride in what they’re wearing, but rings true that attention to detail is everything.\n\nScott Barlow / Flickr\nScott Barlow / Flickr\n13. You Can Drive The Mark Twain\nIf you’re polite and ask nicely, you may be able to drive the Mark Twain Steamboat. While it’s technically on rails, it’d still be fun to spin the wheel and ring the bell!\n\nPublic Domain\nPublic Domain\n14. The Plants In Tomorrowland Are Edible\nWalt believed the future would be self-sustaining, so each plant is edible.\n\nDepositPhotos.com\nDepositPhotos.com\n15. Cast Members Are Encouraged To Help\nWhether a guest is lost, needs a family photo or a child drops an ice cream cone, cast members are encouraged to help whenever and however possible to each guest has a wonderful and magical time at the park.\n\ntastemaven / Flickr\ntastemaven / Flickr\n16. There Is Always A Trash Can Within 30 Steps\nIt’s been said that Disney was disgusted over how dirty theme parks and festivals were. He made a point to watch how far people carried trash before dropping it. The magical number? 30 steps.\n\n\nMatthew Cooper / Flickr\nMatthew Cooper / Flickr\n17. The Ground Is Painted To Enhance Photos\nKodak did a study with Disney and painted the ground to make each photo appear more vivid.\n\nadameq2 / DepositPhotos\nadameq2 / DepositPhotos\n18. Walt Disney Created Fictitious Companies To Purchase Disney World\nWhy? To help disguise the intent of his grandiose plans. Today, you can find the names of these fictitious companies, like Tomahawk Properties, Compass East Corporation and Bay Lake Properties, throughout the park – cleverly disguised as store and shop names.\n\ncholprapha / iStock\ncholprapha / iStock\n19. There’s A Secret Police\nDressed in common civilian clothes, these sneaky officers monitor the safety and well-being of park-goers without disturbing the magic.\n\nJames Palmer / Flickr\nJames Palmer / Flickr\n20. The Tree Of Life Is Actually An Oil Rig\nDesigners and engineers determined an oil rig was one of the strongest structures and thus used it for this attraction.\n\nAneese / iStock\nAneese / iStock\n21. Staff Can Play Basketball In The Matterhorn\nYes, there’s a secret basketball court on the third level- how cool is that?\n\nRussell102 / iStock\nRussell102 / iStock\n22. People Have Tried To Spread Deceased Family Members’ Ashes In The Park\nFor the record, this has and never will be allowed at Disney. Yet it still hasn’t stopped people from trying.\n\nJoe Penniston / Flickr\nJoe Penniston / Flickr\n23. In The “Hall Of Presidents” Bill Clinton Is Wearing His Favorite Iron Man Watch\nIf you look closely, the time is correct too.\n\nRick Vink / Flickr\nRick Vink / Flickr\n24. Fourteen Of The Original Attractions Are Still In Use Today\nIt’s a Small World\nDumbo the Flying Elephant\nFrontierland Shootin’ Arcade\nThe Hall of Presidents\nMad Tea Party\nPeter Pan’s Flight\nPrince Charming Regal Carrousel\nSwiss Family Treehouse\nJungle Cruise\nCountry Bear Jamboree\nWalt Disney World Railroad\nThe Haunted Mansion\nWalt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room\nTomorrowland Speedway\nChris Dikos / Flickr\nChris Dikos / Flickr\n25. Cinderella’s Castle Has A Secret Suite, And It Cannot Be Booked\nOriginally intended to be an apartment for Walt Disney, it’s now only used for special promotions and giveaways, so don’t expect to be able to book it for a night while staying at the resort.\n\nMark Walter/ Flickr\nMark Walter/ Flickr\n26. None Of The Disney Shops Sell Gum\nThis is another way to help keep the park clean and free of gum being stuck to its masterful pieces, streets, and rides.\n\nRK*Pictures / Flickr\nRK*Pictures / Flickr\n27. Smellitizers Are Scattered Throughout The Resort\nNext time you’re at the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction, you’ll notice a faint, yet obvious smell of salty air. On Main Street, you may smell baking cookies or vanilla.\n\nMickey Views / Flickr\nMickey Views / Flickr\n28. The Brown Concrete Path Reflects Sewage During That Time Period\nHmmm tasty, right? Thankfully, I don’t believe they use smellitizers here…\n\nEat My Disney Dust / Flickr\nEat My Disney Dust / Flickr\n29. Main Street Has Over 100,000 Light Bulbs\nTalk about a huge electric bill – for one street alone!\n\nJodi Renshaw / Flickr\nJodi Renshaw / Flickr\n30. The Cast Cannot Grow Facial Hair\nUnless a mustache or beard is fully grown before being hired or grown while away on vacation, men cannot have stubble or facial hair.\n\nJustin Barton / Flickr\nJustin Barton / Flickr\n31. There’s A Secret Speakeasy\nThere’s only two places an adult can get a cocktail: one is the Little Mermaid-themed restaurant, and the other is a super secret speakeasy, Club 33. But don’t expect to bop in there for a quick drink – there’s a ten year waiting list. Open since 1967, the club costs $10,000 a year and has a $25,000 initiation fee per person.\n\nDisney Dan / Flickr\nDisney Dan / Flickr\n32. The Characters’ Moods Change Throughout The Day\nThey’re more perky and peppy in the morning and more mellow in the evening to match the moods of their guests.\n\nMichaelGordon1 / iStock\nMichaelGordon1 / iStock\n33. Steve Martin Worked At DisneyLand\nAs a child, he sold guidebooks then later advanced to working at the Magic Shop.\n\nDavid Bjorgen / Wikimedia Commons\nDavid Bjorgen / Wikimedia Commons\n34. Real Skeletons Were Used In The Pirates Of The Caribbean Attraction\nWhen first opened to the public, fake skeletons look well, rather fake. Replacements were ordered, all issues from a medical institute that had been used for study. According to Buzzfeed, there’s still a real skull there today.\n\nRon Thorp / Flickr\nRon Thorp / Flickr\n35. Disney Has A Huge Staff\nThere are approximately 28,000 cast members that work at Disneyland.\n\nCourtesy Disney’s Art of Animation Resort\nCourtesy Disney’s Art of Animation Resort\n36.
