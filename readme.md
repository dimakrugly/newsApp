# What's that? 

This is a React Native project called News App, developed for both Android and iOS platforms. The app provides users with a comprehensive list of news articles and allows them to add and delete news items. It incorporates user-friendly features such as long presses, bottom sheets, and FlatList for efficient rendering. This project showcases my ability to create dynamic and interactive mobile applications using React Native.
